SUMMARY OF MAINTENANCE WINDOW
Summary
In this activity, the Girardot - Ibague section will be intervened, given the ringed topology of the network, the services will not be affected. The activity will be carried out in order to carry out bidirectional certification of the Girardot - Ibague link corresponding to the national ring and Globenet networks in order to identify and correct high events (if found) that are degrading current services. This email It is informative in nature since Globenet services are not affected. It is noteworthy that the services will not be affected by maintenance, possibly a flap in the switching, commutation or hit in the service, due to the redundancy that exists in the western zone. The activity must be carried out during daylight hours due to public order problems (common crime) at the points where the link must be intervened.

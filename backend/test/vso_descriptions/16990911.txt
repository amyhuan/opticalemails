Planned Works Details:

Planned Work (PW)Ref.:   CRQ1-57049269550
Start Date & Time:             19/2/2023 08:00:00(GMT)*
End Date & Time:              19/2/2023 16:00:00 (GMT)*
Outage Duration:              480 Minutes

Justification of the work: We are required to relocate and divert our cables and network route at Toemaattragel in Gent due to the construction of a new sewage system where our fiber is located.  The existing network is at risk of major faults and damage if it remains in Situ. The work schedule has been provided by the local civil authorities, and  if we do not carry it out, our cables shall be permanently damaged resulting in disruption to your service. Our engineers will cut, then move the cable, and re-splice the fibres.  As the cable will be cut and have to be moved, there is no back-out plan for this work. The mentioned outage duration is a best estimation for the work at hand, but should you ascertain that you are experiencing any prolonged connection issues exceeding this during the works, please contact our technical service desk to investigate the matter https://www.colt.net/support/

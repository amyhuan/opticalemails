DESCRIPTION: Equinix Critical Facility Engineers and generator service vendor personnel will perform routine preventative maintenance on Generators G1A & GSA. During the planned maintenance, only (1) generator will be removed from service at a time and the other will remain available to assume load as needed. No service impact is expected and all customer load will remain supplied by UPS conditioned power. This work requires operation with reduced generator redundancy.

The equipment being maintained supports your circuits indicated in the table.

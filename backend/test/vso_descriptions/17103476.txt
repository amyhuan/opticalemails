Summary:

Lumen intends to carry out internal maintenance within its network. This has been designated as ESSENTIAL. The nature of this work is to insert a node into an existing ring configuration and roll customer traffic to the new path and is required in order to expand existing network infrastructure by adding capacity to allow for improved service features and to pave the way for future service expansion.
An alternate/backup maintenance window has been scheduled in the event work is unable to be completed on the primary night. Currently no services are scheduled to be impacted on the alternate night.

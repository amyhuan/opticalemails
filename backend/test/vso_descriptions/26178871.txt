Dear GR-IX::Athens members,

this is to inform you that there will be scheduled works on our fiber network that will cause interruption on the 2x10GE link between GR-IX nodes ATH01 (EIE) and ATH03 (TIS) and on the 200GE link between GR-IX nodes ATH02 (Digital Realty) and ATH03 (TIS). Due to over provision of our backbone links, we don't expect any issues regarding GR-IX traffic between the aforementioned nodes.

Start date/time: 21/12/23, 09:00 (EET)
End date/time: 21/12/23, 14:00 (EET)
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Kind regards,
Georgios Sotiriadis

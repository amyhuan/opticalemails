Dear MICROSOFT,

Please see below details of Planned Works: CRQ000001183788

Detailed Description of Works:

Vodafone are carrying out the software upgrade on the Juniper MX platform in Sofia Telepoint.
This includes the core network router that provides your internet access service.
Due to this work, you will experience a downtime of up to 30 minutes during the maintenance window.
Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

Scheduled Start/End Date & Outage Window:

05/04/2023 20:00 to 06/04/2023 02:00 UTC

Impact Assessment:

There will be a loss of service of up to 30 minutes to all services during the outage window

Fall Back Plan:

Within the window times, we will have regression time accounted for to ensure that if new any issues are found after the upgrade, we are then able to downgrade the router and restore customer service back to the original software release.

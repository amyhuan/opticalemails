Dear members and customers,

On Friday 9rd of June 2023 between 00:01 - 05:00 CET, the following maintenance will be carried out. 

• Due to the necessary optimization of the traffic flows we will be moving some customers from NIX2-acc3 to another switch: NIX2-acc4 and NIX2-acc5


List of customers:

Cetin 
Web4U
Activ24
ITS
Casablanca (one port)
RSD


An outage of affected ports will occur for approx. 60 minutes.
Before the port gets disconnected, we are going to apply the BGP Culling ACL to force the shutdown of the BGP sessions of the affected clients (according to rfc8327).
We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.

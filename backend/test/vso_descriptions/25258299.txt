DESCRIPTION: Facilities Engineers alongside vendor services will perform annual preventative maintenance on the generator paralleling switchgear on the 6th floor. No customer loads will be transferred to perform this activity. While no unavailability is expected, the facility will operate at a reduced level of redundancy during this maintenance.

The equipment being maintained supports your circuits indicated in the table.

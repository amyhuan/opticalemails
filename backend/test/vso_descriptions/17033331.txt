Description of Works
Emergency change to relocate affected cables between hand holes on our South African network. We urgently need to relocate the affected cables between hand holes to avoid damage by contractors digging in the area. If the infrastructure is not relocated the contractors will damage it and cause major outages during office hours.
Due to the condition of the joint and amount of fibres affected, with the scope of work that needs to be implemented the team requires an extended time to complete the change.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this maintenance activity may cause.

For all future communication regarding this case, please reply to this mail or write to us at changemanagement@wiocc.net quoting the WIOCC ticket

Sincerely,

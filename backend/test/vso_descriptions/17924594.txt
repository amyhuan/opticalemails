Justification of the work: Our Network monitoring team is observing an optical degradation on a Colt long distance network link between Worms and RÃ¼sselsheim which could become service affecting if not attended. During this work, our engineers will clean and replace the patches, and check the street fibre under supervision of Colt NOC.  This will be followed by an OTDR test to ensure no micro bends or breaks are present. The maintenance should be completed during the first 7 hours of the maintenance, but an 8 hour window is quoted to cover all eventualities. Back-out plan: 60 minutes of the maintenance window is reserved to revert any changes one should we experience any unforeseen issues during the works. The mentioned outage duration is a best estimation for the work at hand, but should you ascertain that you are experiencing any prolonged connection issues exceeding this during the works, please contact our technical service desk to investigate the matter https://www.colt.net/support/

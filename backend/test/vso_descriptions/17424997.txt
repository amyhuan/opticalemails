DESCRIPTION: Equinix will be performing switching operations to allow us to complete a scheduled preventative maintenance to our HV transformers.
Transformer reference:- TX-3.2

Power will be provided by the Utility supply with Generator system backup.
System transformer redundancy will be reduced to N. Customer supplies will still be 2N at customer rack.
Only 1 TX will be worked on at a time and load will be supported by the alternative transformer for the duration of the works.
Customer cabinets will remain protected by Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).

If attending site you may notice the lighting will switch off momentarily within the Data Centre, this is normal practice. Emergency lighting will provide adequate illumination throughout the facility during this period.

The equipment being maintained supports your circuits indicated in the table.

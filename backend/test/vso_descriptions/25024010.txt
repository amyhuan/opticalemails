Dear HKIX participant,

 

RS1 (2001:7FA:0:1::CA28:A101) is going to have maintenance on 17-Sep-2023 (Sunday) 02:00 – 08:00 HKT (UTC +8).

RS2 (2001:7FA:0:1::CA28:A102) is going to have maintenance on 24-Sep-2023 (Sunday) 02:00 – 08:00 HKT (UTC +8).

 

During the maintenance, your BGP sessions with one route server may be up and down but your BGP sessions with another route server will NOT be affected and the multi-lateral peering can still be maintained.

 

If you have not set up the IPv6 BGP sessions with both RS1 & RS2, you should do it ASAP for better resilience.

Maintenance:

Planned maintenance of HKIX IPv6 Route Servers

  

Impact:

There will be no impact to HKIX participants which have BGP sessions with both IPv6 route servers RS1 (2001:7FA:0:1::CA28:A101) & RS2 (2001:7FA:0:1::CA28:A102). During the maintenance, your BGP sessions with one route server may be up and down but your BGP sessions with the another route server will NOT be affected and the multi-lateral peering can still be maintained.

 

If you have not set up the IPv6 BGP sessions with both RS1 & RS2, you should do it ASAP for better resilience.  

 

Thank you for your attention.

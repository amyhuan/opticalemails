Description of Work:  

 

The integration of the ASC to the new Darwin Jakarta Singapore Cable system is planned to take place during the rescheduled window of the 21st to 25th April 2023. The work needed to be postponed to these new dates due to Cyclone Ilsa. As was previously indicated, the precise date and time is not able to be easily predicted, as there are many variables experienced by the cable laying ship; including weather and ocean currents. The purpose of this hazardous change notification is to let you know the window of this activity. We do not expect any impact to services during this 5-day change window, but wanted to let you know in advance of the activity being undertaken on the ASC system.

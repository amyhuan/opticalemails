Description of Works
For the 1st activity, SEACOM will be conducting equipment migration activity between Abu Talat and Marseilles. The provisional maintenance window is one (1) day, commencing from 00:01GMT on the 26th of February, 2023, until 23:59GMT on the 26th February, 2023. Once activity commences, transmission services with linear traffic routing from South and East Africa towards Europe and traversing Egypt will be affected for fourteen (14) hours during the maintenance window. Customers with IP/MPLS services from East Africa and Maputo towards Europe will have their traffic re-routed via alternative paths and could experience altered latency during this time.

For the 2nd Activity, SEACOM will conduct fibre-swapping activities at Marseille that have arisen due to emergency tramway infrastructure work on the existing fibre route. The provisional maintenance window is seven (7) hours, from 22:59 GMT, 27th February 2023, until 06:00 GMT, 28th February 2023. Once the maintenance activity commences, linear transmission traffic routing from South and East Africa towards Europe traversing via Egypt will be affected for one (1) hour across the maintenance window. IP/MPLS customers with protected traffic in East Africa and Maputo to various destinations in Europe will have their traffic re-routed via alternative paths and could experience altered latency.

We apologize for any inconvenience that this maintenance activity may cause.

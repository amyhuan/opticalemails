Maintenance activity:
Please be advised of essential maintenance work required on our NEOS Fibre Network Platform. We are required to carry out joint audit, to determine existing splicing and condition of joint enclosure. If required a joint rebuild will be arranged under a planned outage later and you will be notified accordingly. These works are part of a wider project to improve existing service between our datacentres, this will provide a more resilient network and increase capacity for future business provisions. We have been advised that the joints we are entering are known to be troublesome, you may see brief service hits and therefore we are advising you accordingly, we apologise for any inconvenience in advance. NB. these works are being carried out in two phases. Phase 1: is the desilt within chambers and this work will be carried out between 20:00 - 23:00 and is deemed not service impacting. Phase 2: This is the heightened risk activity and will not commence until post 23:00 hours.

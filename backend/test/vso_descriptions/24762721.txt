Reason for Maintenance: Zayo will implement demand maintenance to perform rehab/upgrade to splice enclosure. It will be difficult to pinpoint when your service will go down exactly, however once down, that same day you will be restored. Once back up, your service will not experience any further outages throughout the maintenance window nor in TTN-0006893113 as both tickets are for the same project. The estimated GPS location of work is 36.11087, -86.78631.

This is a note to let you know that we'll soon be doing some network maintenance. While we don't expect any impacts to your service/s, as part of our agreement with you we need to keep you informed of even the low-risk changes we make.

We typically aim to give you 14 days' notice of planned maintenances, however this change has come with a little more urgency. We apologise for the shorter than usual notice.

Scheduled Maintenance #: 26475353

Summary:

Lumen intends to carry out internal maintenance within its network. This has been designated as URGENT. The nature of this work is to relocate fiber cable on the Lumen network and is required in order to proactively avoid unplanned outages due to Indiana Department of Transportation (I-DoT) mandated construction.

The estimated GPS location of work is: GPS LOCATION 1: 39.276392, -84.842809; GPS LOCATION 2: 39.276299, -84.830589

The maintenance consists of multiple nights and customers will only receive notification for the night their services will be impacted.

Note: Due to a lack of slack in the cable, this work will be performed as a hot cut. Each buffer tube will be restored as quickly as possible, and the outage duration will range between 1 and 5 hours depending on splice restoration order. However, customers listed for an outage should prepare for an impact up to 6 hours during the maintenance window.

An alternate/backup maintenance window has been scheduled in the event work is unable to be completed on the primary night. Currently no services are scheduled to be impacted on the alternate night. Should the alternate night be deemed necessary, you will receive an updated notification advising which services will be impacted on that night. Please see the date and times of the alternate night below.

Lumen sincerely apologizes for any inconvenience caused by this maintenance.

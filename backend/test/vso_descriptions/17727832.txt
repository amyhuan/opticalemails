SUMMARY OF MAINTENANCE WINDOW
Summary
In this activity, the Fusagasugá - Melgar section will be intervened, given the ringed topology of the network, the services will not be affected. The activity will be carried out in order to create a change of route at the request of the VIA40 Express road concession, for the construction of the third lane between Bogotá and Girardot in the Glorieta del Indio sector in Fusagasugá. It is noteworthy that the services will not be affected by maintenance, possibly a flap in the switching, commutation or hit in the service, due to the redundancy that exists in the western area.
